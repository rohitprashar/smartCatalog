<p>Hi I have the same problem!! I figure out the way to fix it.
    First you need to ng add @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap
    instead of install like from the lecture
    Second add
    
    ng serve again
    It works!!

<button class="btn btn-primary" (click)="submit()">Submit</button>
</p>


<h2 *ngFor="let s of serviceProviders">
    Your Message is {{s.serviceName}}
